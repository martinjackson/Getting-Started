# How to Get Started with React & Electron

**Development tools needed**
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)


## Starting the project

```
cd ~/projects
```

create a new project
```
git clone https://github.com/martinjackson/Getting-Started-With-React.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

run and play with the Electron Example Live
```
cd electron-example/
yarn
atom .
yarn start
```

You have running react project with live-reload.  Modify your components and when you save them the MHR will reload your browser and show you the changes.
Now, lets add Electron and make this a stand-alone app.
